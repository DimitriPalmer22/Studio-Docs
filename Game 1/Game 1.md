# Art Style

This game uses a [non-photorealistic art style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-photorealistic_rendering). To achieve this, the game uses cel shading, a limited color palette, and outlines around objects.

## Inspirations

- Very flat coloring on the textures of the characters. The cel shading gives the characters some depth within the scene.
- The colors used for the character here make them stand out from the background, even though the background is very colorful.
- The outlines around the characters make them pop out from the background. Also, the use of colored outlines makes the characters stand out even more

### XIII (Original & Remake)

### Borderlands

### Hi-Fi Rush
