# High Concept
feeling cool

# Feature List

# Core Mechanics
### Melee Combos

The game should feel *a little* like the Batman Arkham series, but with more control over the combos. Those games just felt like you were pressing buttons and Batman did everything for you.

A better reference for the combat is the Devil May Cry series. The player should have a lot of control over the combos they perform. The player should be able to chain together different attacks to create their own combos. In this way, the Ninja Gaiden games (specifically 1 and 2) are also a good reference.

The game's melee combat should be easy enough that the player can pick it up and play without too much difficulty. However, the combat system should feel deep enough that the game allows the player to become really good at it.

### Ranged Attacks

### Block

Hold the block button to *reduce* the damage you take from an attack (not all attacks are able to be blocked).

### Perfect Dodge

Think of the Bleach flash step or vanishing in Dragon Ball Z. After performing a perfect dodge, time slows down *a little bit* and the player can perform a counter attack. This counter attack animation is *fast* enough to work against the time slowdown. This is so it can be used to interrupt

# Art Style

This game uses a [non-photorealistic art style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-photorealistic_rendering). To achieve this, the game uses cel shading, a limited color palette, and outlines around objects.

## Inspirations

### Jet Set Radio

- Very flat coloring on the textures of the characters. The cel shading gives the characters some depth within the scene.
- The colors used for the character here make them stand out from the background, even though the background is very colorful.
- The outlines around the characters make them pop out from the background. Also, the use of colored outlines makes the characters stand out even more
- ***NOTE***: The models in Jet Set Radio are made in a way that makes the outline shader work well. The models are made with the outline shader in mind.

### XIII (Original & Remake)

### Borderlands

### Hi-Fi Rush

# Overview

This game centers around the player feeling *cool*. With everything the player does, they should be aura farming. The game should be a power trip.
