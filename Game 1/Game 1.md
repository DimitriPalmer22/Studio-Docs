# High Concept
feeling cool

# Feature List

# Core Mechanics
### Melee Combos

The game should feel *a little* like the Batman Arkham series, but with more control over the combos. Those games just felt like you were pressing buttons and Batman did everything for you.

A better reference for the combat is the Devil May Cry series. The player should have a lot of control over the combos they perform. The player should be able to chain together different attacks to create their own combos. In this way, the Ninja Gaiden games (specifically 1 and 2) are also a good reference.

### Ranged Attacks
### Dodge

Think of the Bleach flash step or vanishing in Dragon Ball Z.

### Active Ability
### Passive Ability

# Art Style

This game uses a [non-photorealistic art style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-photorealistic_rendering). To achieve this, the game uses cel shading, a limited color palette, and outlines around objects.

## Inspirations

### Jet Set Radio

- Very flat coloring on the textures of the characters. The cel shading gives the characters some depth within the scene.
- The colors used for the character here make them stand out from the background, even though the background is very colorful.
- The outlines around the characters make them pop out from the background. Also, the use of colored outlines makes the characters stand out even more

### XIII (Original & Remake)

### Borderlands

### Hi-Fi Rush

# Overview

This game centers around the player feeling *cool*. With everything the player does, they should be aura farming. The game should be a power trip.
