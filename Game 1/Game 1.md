# Feature List

# Core Mechanics
### Melee Combos

The game should feel *a little* like the Batman Arkham series, but with more control over the combos. Those games just felt like you were pressing buttons and Batman did everything for you.

A better reference for the combat is the Devil May Cry series. The player should have a lot of control over the combos they perform. The player should be able to chain together different attacks to create their own combos. In this way, the Ninja Gaiden games (specifically 1 and 2) are also a good reference.

The game's melee combat should be easy enough that the player can pick it up and play without too much difficulty. However, the combat system should feel deep enough that the game allows the player to become really good at it.

Some combos are very basic and can be performed by pressing the attack button once or twice. However, like Ninja Gaiden, executing specific combos will lead into 

#### Roguelike Element
- The player starts off with the same couple of basic combo strings

### Ranged Attacks

### Block

Hold the block button to *reduce* the damage you take from an attack (not all attacks are able to be blocked).

### Perfect Dodge

Think of the Bleach flash step or vanishing in Dragon Ball Z. After performing a perfect dodge, time slows down *a little bit* and the player can perform a counter attack. This counter attack animation is *fast* enough to work against the time slowdown. This is so it can be used to interrupt an enemy's attack or break their combo.

### Aura Meter (Name Pending)

Performing perfect dodges and combos fills up the meter. As the meter fills up, the player does slightly more damage and their combos get a little faster.

However, getting hit, not attacking for a while, and blocking for too long will drain the meter. This should encourage the player to have a high risk, high reward playstyle.

### Active Ability

Using the active ability will

### Passive Ability

The passive ability has a meter requirement, meaning that the *meter* has to be above a certain threshold in order for the passive ability to activate. A UI icon should indicate when the passive ability is available (Like the icon for the passive is usually greyed out, but when the *meter* is above the threshold, the icon lights up). Different passive abilities have different thresholds.

# Art Style

This game uses a [non-photorealistic art style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-photorealistic_rendering). To achieve this, the game uses cel shading, a limited color palette, and outlines around objects.

## Inspirations

### Jet Set Radio

- Very flat coloring on the textures of the characters. The cel shading gives the characters some depth within the scene.
- The colors used for the character here make them stand out from the background, even though the background is very colorful.
- The outlines around the characters make them pop out from the background. Also, the use of colored outlines makes the characters stand out even more
- ***NOTE***: The models in Jet Set Radio are made in a way that makes the outline shader work well. The models are made with the outline shader in mind.

### XIII (Original & Remake)

### Borderlands

### Hi-Fi Rush

# Overview

This game centers around the player feeling *cool*. With everything the player does, they should be aura farming. The game should be a power trip.
