# Topic: Making a Game Pitch

### Overview

Here are a couple things to keep in mind when making a game pitch. These will help whoever's working on the project understand what they'll be committing their time to.
### ChatGPT Prompt
**Role**: You are a veteran creative director with 10+ years at studios like Insomniac or Arkane Lyon, known for pitching and shipping critically acclaimed, innovative titles (e.g., _Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart_, _Dishonored_).

**Context**: I’m a game designer transitioning to creative director. I need a **structured framework** to generate, stress-test, and pitch a game concept that:
1. Balances **creative vision** with **technical/budget feasibility** (team size: 10, budget: FREE).
2. Solves a **clear market gap** (e.g., "Cozy games lack _Dark Souls_-like depth" or "No narrative-driven FPS for VR").
3. Aligns with my team’s **core strengths** (e.g., strong environmental storytelling, weak multiplayer netcode).

**Task**: _Provide a battle-tested ideation framework, including:_
1. **3 Creative Pillars** – Questions to define the game’s soul (e.g., "What emotion should players feel every 10 minutes?").
2. **Constraints-Driven Brainstorming** – Use limitations (budget, team skills, tech) as _fuel_, not obstacles.
3. **USP (Unique Selling Proposition) Generator** – A formula to isolate what makes the idea _irresistible_ to publishers/players.
4. **Pitch Structure** – A slide-by-slide template optimized for team buy-in (e.g., "Problem → Solution → Proof of Feasibility").

**Constraints**:
- Avoid vague prompts like "think outside the box."
- Include **3 AAA and 3 indie case studies** (e.g., how _Hades_ combined roguelikes with narrative).
- Provide a **SWOT analysis template** (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) for stress-testing ideas.
- Warn against **common pitch pitfalls** (e.g., overpromising scope, ignoring audience).

## 1. Three Creative Pillars

| Pillar               | Core Question                                                        | Example Outcome                         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Emotional Spine**  | What core feeling do we want players to experience every 10 minutes? | “Awe of scale + intimacy”               |
| **Interactive Hook** | Which single mechanic will define the loop and reinforce the spine?  | “Dimension‑shift puzzles”               |
| **Narrative Thread** | What story beat anchors player choice to world reaction?             | “Every choice ripples through NPC arcs” |

## 2. Constraints‑Driven Brainstorming

- **List your hard limits** (team skills, “free” budget = sweat equity, tech stack).
- **Reframe each limit as a fuel question** (e.g. “How can we turn lack of netcode into solo‑first emergent AI?”).
- **Rapid‑fire ideation (15 m)**: generate 20 seeds, tag each with which constraint it leans on.
- **Cluster & prune**: retain ideas that lean on 2+ constraints (highest leverage).

## 3. USP Generator
Use this formula to clarify your hook on one slide:

> **For** _[audience segment]_ **who** _[unmet need]_,
> **[Game Name]** is a _[genre/mechanic combo]_ **that** _[core emotional promise]_
> **Unlike** _[closest competitor]_, it _[key differentiator]_.

— _Example:_

> For “cozy‑RPG fans craving tension,” **Hearthforge** is a “town‑builder with live raid events” that delivers “heartbeat‑racing stakes in a pastoral setting.” Unlike **Stardew Valley**, it “rewards proactive defense planning.”

## 4. Pitch Slide‑by‑Slide Template
- **Title & Tagline**
- **Market Gap** (data/quotes)
- **High‑Concept & Pillars** (1 slide)
- **Core Loop & Prototype Art**
- **Case Studies** (see below)
- **Feasibility** (team chart, free‑budget plan)
- **Roadmap & Milestones**
- **SWOT Analysis** (template below)
- **Ask & Next Steps**

## 5. Case Studies

### AAA
- **Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart** – leveraged PS5 SSD to hide loading in gameplay (Dimension‑hop core loop).
- **Dishonored** – environmental storytelling + emergent AI choices created a player‑driven narrative.
- **God of War (2018)** – one‑shot camera + deep character arc built cinematic intimacy.

### Indie
- **Hades** – wove narrative into every roguelike run; high replay valorizes narrative beats.
- **Celeste** – minimalist dev team turned tight controls + mental‑health theme into critical darling.
- **Hollow Knight** – handcrafted world + simple combat achieved Metroid‑style depth on small budget.

## 6. SWOT Analysis Template

| Strengths                     | Weaknesses                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| • Unique tech leverage        | • Gaps in skillset          |
| • Core team’s narrative flair | • Scope‑vs‑free‑budget risk |

| Opportunities                 | Threats                       |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| • Untapped subgenre audiences | • AAA competitor announcement |
| • Platform‑specific hooks     | • Feature creep               |

## 7. Common Pitch Pitfalls

- **Overpromising scope**: “Everything, everywhere” kills credibility.
- **Ignoring core audience**: pitching to “everyone” → resonates with no one.
- **Skipping feasibility**: missing a tech‑stack slide flags you as naive.
- **Under‑cooking the USP**: if you can swap your pitch into ten other games, you lack distinctiveness.

Use this as your “playbook” each time you ideate: start with the pillars, fuel ideas off your limits, refine with the USP formula, stress‑test in SWOT, then pack it into the nine‑slide deck. That structure keeps vision and feasibility in lock‑step.
