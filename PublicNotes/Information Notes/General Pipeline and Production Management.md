One of the main issues I had with Relapse is how unplanned things felt. There was never a point where I felt like I could look 2 weeks in the future and would know what exactly everyone would be working on and what the game would look like. As a result, several issues kept appearing:
- Scope creep
- Established ideas kept changing because of new content
- Content kept getting added to the game right before deadlines, which led to a lack of polish for some things.

I want to avoid this with the new game. I want to have a clear idea of what the game will look like, how it will play, and what the scope is. This way, I can plan out the next 2-3 months of development and know exactly what everyone is working on.
