# Modular Kits

- We're basing the game's modular kit off of Matthew's modular kit.
- His will serve as the base, and we'll take pieces from the other kits
- Most of his pieces are 10m x 10m, which is really big BUT we can create some half-pieces to increase granularity.

#### Aiden
- Aiden's walls are 5m wide x 17m tall. His walls (the ones in the pic below) are good candidates for some half-width walls if we cut them to match the size of Matthew's kit (5m wide & 10m tall)

- There is also another wall in hit kit we can use as a half-width half-height wall (make it 5m wide x 5m tall)

- These candle stands are cool

#### Brian
- Something I like from Brian's level is the idea of having balconies that overlook the main room. These balconies are inaccessible and just there for visual interest.
- The fences are also a nice touch, but I'm not sure how well they'll align with the grid / align with the other pieces.
- For the large hallway w/ the section that has the large floating mana crystal, that mana crystal is cool as a unique piece that only appears in some levels.
- Brian's kit has a lot of unique pieces that are great for adding detail, but for right now we'll focus on the more basic pieces from the other kits.

#### Leo
- Leo's room shape was definitely the most interesting and least like a "big hallway"
	- The only issue was that his room was a little small, but that can be fixed
- The reason his room shape was so interesting was because the pieces in his modular kit were small enough to facilitate having rooms of many different sizes and shapes
- He also had variations of his walls, which kept the environment from looking too same-y (flat walls & walls w/ the windows)
- He also had pillars INSIDE the walls to add more depth to the walls.
	- The wall pillars weren't actually a part of the wall's model, they were their own asset.
	- This allowed him to place them wherever he wanted, which allowed him to further customize the look of his room.
