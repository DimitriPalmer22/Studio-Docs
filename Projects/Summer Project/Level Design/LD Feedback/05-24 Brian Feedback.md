# Brian's Level

Brian's Level is called `BrianKitSizeTestLevel`. It is currently on the `feature/BrianKitSizeTest` branch, so if you want to open it and look around, you can.

> This big orb is supposed to represent a floating mana crystal

- Brian included this large floating crystal orb at the end of his level as a large visual landmark. I think this is a great idea.
- *However*, a prop this unique and large needs to be used sparingly.
	- Also, not every level can have a prop this attention-grabbing.
	- Keep in mind all the space he needed around it to have it within the level.
- If you also have an idea for a large prop, make sure you get approval for it first.
- When thinking of props for your levels, try to think of props that can be reused in multiple levels without feeling out of place or are too unique.

> The main area in Brian's level is roughly 45 meters x 27 meters.

- After getting a good look at the level in-engine. I'd say *50 meters is around the max* any one room should be in one direction.
- Brian's level contained some placeholder props, which made the 27 meter width feel a little cramped. So, I asked him to make the level a little wider.

> Brian's level is roughly 18-19 meters tall (excluding the arching roof)

- The height of this level is similar to Leo's revised level. I'm definitely liking this height.
- Something interesting he did was add a balcony / second floor to add detail to the upper sections of the walls (Inaccessible btw).
	- This added a lot of visual interest to the upper sections of the walls.
	- Somebody might ask "How is *anyone* supposed to get up there", but lowkey this might be one of those questions that gets ignored
