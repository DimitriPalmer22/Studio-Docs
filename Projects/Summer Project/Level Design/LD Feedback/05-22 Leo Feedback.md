> Every white primitive shape (the cylinders, rectangular prisms, and cones) are placeholders for actual probs (a pillar, a table, and mana crystals)

- Leo made his level with actual openings for the windows.
	- I personally think we should move away from having real windows because they show the game outside the level, which may contain janky geometry or other funky stuff to make the game work
	- I instead suggested that if we're gonna have windows, then the window panes can be textures that look like stained glass so the player can't actually see outside the level
- Also, those triangle-shaped things in the windows are supposed to be mana crystals
	- We should probably find a place for those within the level itself like on the walls or in the corners.
	- They look a little weird in the windows.
# Taller Rooms

- Andre, Leo, and I were in a call and we were looking for ways to make the levels more interesting
- Somebody then brought up the idea of using Elden Ring's interior levels as references for what the spaces should look like (an idea that I like)
	- Specifically, we can look at interior spaces in Raya Lucaria since they fit the scholarly magic aesthetic I want for the rooms in Avernoth
- Andre then brought up how tall Elden Ring's rooms are. They really make the space feel grand.

# Leo's Revised Level

> Literally, all we did was copy the walls surrounding the level and copy-paste them on top of each other two more times to make the room taller.

> Immediately, we noticed that the ceiling / skybox is no longer in the view of the player. They would have to look up to see it.

> Although there are props that line the bottom of the walls to populate the space, the upper sections of the walls now need some set-dressing. They seem a little flat and unappealing.

- Leo's individual wall kit pieces are 6 meters tall. We stacked 3 walls on top of each other, making the room 18 meters tall in total.
- After making Leo's level taller, we decided that we liked this wayyyyy more.
	- The space immediately became way less claustrophobic
	- Putting a roof on this taller version of the room made it feel way more complete without making the room look awkward

- How should we set-dress the upper sections of the walls?
	- One thing that we thought of was making little balconies that line the walls
	- We could also have very very tall props that extend to the upper sections of the walls

# This Level is Still Too Small

![](<../../../../_Meta/Attachments/Pasted image 20250522155740.png>)

> The space is very roughly 24 meters x 22 meters

- This level is still too small in terms of length and width. I think the playable area is too small for the player to move around in
- The level feels especially small because:
	- The pillar in the middle off the room breaks up the space
	- The props along the edges of the walls (the white blocks that are supposed to be bookshelves and tables) cut down the surface area of the playable space
- Camera problems
	- The camera is a little far back from the player, so the space needs to be larger to accommodate this
	- A problem consistent in 3rd person games with interior spaces is that the camera often gets caught on props and stuff. We need a more open area to prevent this.
- One thing that *will* help with gauging how big the room should be is placing down mannequins to mimic the enemies in the level.
	- This way, we can see more easily if a level feels too dense or needs to be populated more with assets or enemies

# Ideas For Set-Dressing & A Little Bit of Environmental Story-Telling
- We were looking at rooms in Skyrim and immediately noticed that the rooms in one building were all set-dressed a little differently because they had different purposes.
- One thing that can help us w/ the set-dressing and environmental story-telling is determining what the crazy mage used each room for while he was temporarily staying there.
	- For example, one room could be a basic study room with a desk and a couple candles
	- Whereas, another room could have been a library room, so there are bookshelves all around
	- Another room could have been an enchantment room, so there is an enchantment table with various artifacts around

- *Please try to think like this so that we can start curating a list of props we request from the environmental artists.*

# Elden Ring References

We were looking at Elden Ring specifically for inspiration for the props, set-dressing, and layout of the levels. Although these are nice references, remember that not everything in Elden Ring may properly translate to our project due to our different art styles.

> The crystals here are kinda what I imagine the mana crystals to look like in our game. A little less dense, though. Imagine these are a lot sparser and placed in the corners of the room or places that seem a little out of the way.

> Also, you guys are allowed to get creative with the props you come up with for the rooms as long as you're allowed to justify why they're in this space. The hanging cages and the tall candle-holders are examples of the types of props you can come up with.

> This isn't an in-game screenshot from Elden Ring. This is a recreation of one of the game's areas by some guy Leo found on ArtStation.

> This reference is interesting because the walls are lined with paintings that give the room / who the room belongs to a little more character.

> Another thing that makes this room interesting is the backdrop of the room. The upper section of the level is completely inaccessible to the player, but adds depth to the room.

> Rennala's boss fight arena is a very intersting place. The upper portion of the level is very detailed and populated. The lower section has really tall stacks of books. Also, the candles used for the lighting are a nice touch.

> I really like the look of the chandeliers in this room. The color of the fires makes the room feel mystical.

> The site of grace in this screenshot gave me an idea. Instead of *just* physical items as props, we can also use magic spells / orbs / whatever as props, too.
