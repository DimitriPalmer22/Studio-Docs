# Taller Rooms!

- Andre, Leo, and I were in a call and we were looking for ways to make the levels more interesting
- Somebody then brought up the idea of using Elden Ring's library as a reference & interiors as whole as references for what the spaces should look like (an idea that I like)
- Andre then brought up how tall Elden Ring's rooms are. They really make the space feel grand.
# This Level is Still Too Small

- This level is still too small in terms of length and width.
- The playable area is too small for the player to move around in
- The level feels especially small because:
	- The pillar in the middle off the room breaks up the space
	- The props along the edges of the walls (the white blocks) cut down the surface area of the playable space
- The camera is a little far back from the player, so the space needs to be larger to accommodate this
