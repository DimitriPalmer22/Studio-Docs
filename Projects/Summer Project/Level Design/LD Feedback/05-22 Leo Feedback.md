# Taller Rooms

- Andre, Leo, and I were in a call and we were looking for ways to make the levels more interesting
- Somebody then brought up the idea of using Elden Ring's interior levels as references for what the spaces should look like (an idea that I like)
	- Specifically, we can look at interior spaces in Raya Lucaria since they fit the scholarly magic aesthetic I want for the rooms in Avernoth
- Andre then brought up how tall Elden Ring's rooms are. They really make the space feel grand.

# Leo's Revised Level

Literally, all we did was copy the walls surrounding the level and copy-paste them on top of each other two more times to make the room taller.

> Immediately, we noticed that the ceiling / skybox is no longer in the view of the player. They would have to look up to see it.

- Leo's individual wall kit pieces are 6 meters tall. We stacked 3 walls on top of each other, making the room 18 meters tall in total.
- After making Leo's level taller, we decided that we liked this wayyyyy more.
	- The space immediately became way less claustrophobic
	- Putting a roof on this taller version of the room made it feel way more complete without making the room look awkward

# This Level is Still Too Small

- This level is still too small in terms of length and width. The playable area is too small for the player to move around in
	- The space is very roughly 24 meters x 22 meters
- The level feels especially small because:
	- The pillar in the middle off the room breaks up the space
	- The props along the edges of the walls (the white blocks that are supposed to be bookshelves and tables) cut down the surface area of the playable space
- Camera problems
	- The camera is a little far back from the player, so the space needs to be larger to accommodate this
	- A problem consistent in 3rd person games with interior spaces is that the camera often gets caught on props and stuff. We need a more open area to prevent this.
- One thing that *will* help with gauging how big the room should be is placing down mannequins to mimic the enemies in the level.
	- This way, we can see more easily if a level feels too dense or needs to be populated more with assets or enemies

# Ideas For Set-Dressing & A Little Bit of Environmental Story-Telling
- We were looking at rooms in Skyrim and immediately noticed that the rooms in one building were all set-dressed a little differently because they had different purposes.
- One thing that can help us w/ the set-dressing and environmental story-telling is determining what the crazy mage used each room for while he was temporarily staying there.
	- For example, one room could be a basic study room with a desk and a couple candles
	- Whereas, another room could have been a library room, so there are bookshelves all around
	- Another room could have been an enchantment room, so there is an enchantment table with various artifacts around
- *Try to think like this so that we can start curating a list of props we request from the environmental artists.*
