# What I Really Like

### Da Props

- I love your props. Seriously, your prop work is pretty much how I envisioned the game.

- I like the fact that you made crystals for your blockout and put the appropriately colored lights on them. This was the first thing that popped out to me. This is EXACTLY what I had in mind.
- I also really liked the circle you used for the player's starting position. It gives us a visual indication of where the player will be starting and gives us room to create another prop to decorate the space.
- The various book piles scattered across the room were another thing that I envisioned almost exactly like how you implemented. These do a good job of filling the space without making it feel cluttered.
- The banners hanging along the walls are a really nice touch as well. They add some depth to the walls and give us a little bit of room for environmental storytelling
- The circular bookshelves (right?) are also a really nice touch. I like the way you made specific wall sections that are meant to a space specifically for them. The do a really nice job of breaking up the flat appearance of the walls.
	- The only thing about these is that once we get the actual prop, we need to make sure it's low-poly / much less circular
- The pillars that extend all the way to the roof are also really sick
- I like the different variations of tables you have. They all seem appropriately sized and do well to fill in the space.
- All of your hanging lighting fixtures are really good
	- The big chandeliers that hang from the ceiling are a really nice touch.
	- The smaller hanging lights that are placed in various areas seem like a really good idea, too. They give the designers an extra opportunity to add some extra lighting to the space in other ways than adding a candle or another big chandelier.
	- The entire block for the hanging light above the circular book cases looks so cool. It's also fire that you put candles on top of these.
- I'm assuming the big white blocks lining the walls are paintings. If that's the case, I don't know how I didn't think of that as a possible prop idea. Nice job

# Things that Can Change

# A Note About Lighting
- After looking at the lights in your level, I immediately realized that I have almost no clue how lighting works in Unreal.
- I checked the GPU profiler just to see how performance was being impacted, and I was a little bit surprised to see just how much performance the lights were costing.
- So, later on in the project, we'll probably be using baked lighting as opposed to Unreal's realtime dynamic lighting system.
