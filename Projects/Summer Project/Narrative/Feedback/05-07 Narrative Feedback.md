# Chelle Notes

Question I've had that wasn't answered here:

- In what way is the seal spell altered so that they can contact the MC?
	- After further consideration, saying that the casting of the Seal Spell was altered might cause some issues for the narrative (Does this affect the other people who are currently in the Seal Realm? Couldn't **Rival Mage** just cast the spell again or something to make sure it works this time?).
	- Instead, I think its better to say something like **Ally 1** casts a very powerful support spell that allows one or more individuals to communicate with, send items to, and cast _some_ spells on another person regardless of distance.

- Does that adjustment contribute to why there is a loop?
	- Not directly, no. The communication spell allows another one of the allies (Not **Ally 1**) to, at the start of each run, cast a spell that creates a "restart point"" for the main character. Whenever the main character dies, they are sent back to this restart point. This spell is extremely draining for whoever casts it, which is why it isn't used more than once per run.
	- The restart spell respawns the main character at the start of the Seal Realm exactly as they were when the spell was cast. This explains why the main character doesn't keep their loot between runs.

- What does the contact look like? Do the people actually show up or is it exactly like Hades where they kind of just talk to him from the beyond?
	- Whenever an individual contacts the main character from the outside, a large portal opens up. On the other side of this portal, the person is visible. Both the main character and the person on the other side can see and hear each other. People absolutely cannot travel through these portals, but individuals on the outside can send small objects through the portal.
	- I do want the people that contact the main character to be visible. Like, the main character can actually see them. Given that we have 2 2D artists, I planned for one of them to focus on character portraits.

- Also, is the Seal Realm a real physical place (like you could get there through some other means) or is it on some other plane of reality?
	- The Seal Realm is not a physical place. There is no way to get there through any means other than using the spell that specifically sends people to the Seal Realm. Not even traditional teleportation spells can send someone there. The Seal Realm is a different plane of reality.

_I think it would be interesting if these interactions were less expository and focused on the present_. maybe even have the MC call shots or give advice to his allies to help in the war?
- I like this idea

## Questions

### Seal Realm
- as for the others who are also trapped in the Seal Realm, do you think it would mostly be people/creatures that deserved it/couldn't be contained outside? or do the people who can send others to the Seal Realm just send whoever they want down there even if they've done nothing wrong?
	- Since the Seal Realm has its own set of ecosystems and environments, I think it makes sense for the weaker creatures to have been born there. For stronger monsters and _some_ people, I think it makes sense for them to have been sent there because there was no other feasible way to contain them.
	- Since the spell that sends people to the Seal Realm is pretty much exclusive to "The Brainrot Empire", "The Brainrot Empire" is kinda characterized by who they choose to send to the Seal Realm. For example, if there were too many people in there that didn't really deserve it, then that paints the "Brainrot Empire" to be a little more evil than I want them to be.
	- So, for the people in the Seal Realm that don't really deserve to be there, I want them to have very specific reasons for being there that are well-explained. For example, maybe they're a victim of **Rival Mage** tweaking out and abusing their power.

- if loops are intended, does the mc get sent right back into the Seal Realm after he escapes? is it actually a prison with infinite layers of seals?
	- The Seal Realm itself doesn't actually have any looping mechanism. That's only because the main character has a spell cast on them by one of their allies, which keeps them alive and resets them whenever they die. For literally anyone else, they would die and stay dead.
	- If someone escapes the Seal Realm, then they are free to leave and return to the normal world.
	- The Seal Realm is finite and does have an exit. However, traversing this realm is so dangerous that most people die once they get too far.

- like Chelle mentioned, if the Seal Realm is a physical place, maybe the contact between the MC and the allies can eventually reveal this fact, and pivot to searching for clues for MC's allies to rescue him from the location
	-

### Main Character
- you mentioned the mc is stripped of his powers before getting sent to the realm. is he still powerless while he's in there? i figured yes as it would justify him having difficulty escaping and needing the power of all the different tomes down there. but, maybe there are systems in place tailored to him specifically that prevent him from just leaving.

- mc fights for the bruhs, but is he from one of the united countries? does he have anyone in particular he's fighting for? is he just looking for a worthy opponent after becoming so powerful?

- does mc have any kind of prior relationship with the rival mage? were they initially part of the same coalition, or have they always been at odds? are the mc or rival mage actually in charge of anything on their respective sides, or are they just the goats that are sent to the frontlines?

### Mana
- how did MC/rival become such powerful mages? its mentioned that you can train to up your mana output, but what exactly separates a weak mage from a powerful one, and what kinds of techniques can they employ?

- its mentioned that countries stayed away from the giant pool of mana while the large beast underground was alive. does that mean mana can have positive/negative energy? do they each have pros/cons or is there a clear delineation between good and bad mana?

- how long has the underground beast been alive? were there others before him? will another beast take its place after a while? it seems like it dying of old age was unexpected, as the bruhs and brainrots sought out to plot the unexplored land when it died.

- is this beast the source of mana? or can mana occur naturally within people/the environment without it?
