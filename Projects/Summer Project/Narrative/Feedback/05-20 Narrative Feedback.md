If we did a format the dialogue similar to Relapse, then this would be an example of a line that's too long. This line is 48 words.

Lines that were about this length felt really comfortable to read.

This line felt like it was at the upper limit of what was comfortable for me to read.

Yeah, after further consideration, I realized there might need to be a couple more scripted interactions in the game (that you don't need to worry about right this second).
Here are some ideas I have for points where we can relay pivotal information to the player
- First spawning into the starting room
- Clearing the first room with enemies in it
- Coming across the first "boon"
- Defeating the entire first level (here we can have the rival mage talk to the player for the first time)
- Respawning back at the starting room after dying for the first time
Also, your assumption that the player needs to choose a boon immediately after starting is correct.

Y'know I never got to read that link when Shbeeb sent it lol. We'll definitely be animating text by the word rather than by the letter. I appreciate ur response here.

Yeah, given that this game places an emphasis on narrative, I think we can afford to slow down the pacing a little bit. I think it's a little unfair to this project for me to fully reapply the same thinking we had for Relapse's narrative.

In terms of that beginning sequence (the part where you imagined the player walking to the portal).
- I didn't have anything specific in mind for that, so I appreciate you coming up with the idea of the player having to interact with the portal on their own after being prompted by prior text.
- Actually, in a gameplay sense, I think this is a really good idea because it introduces the concept of having to interact with these portals to the player. So, I think we should keep this idea.

-----

The moment I read this interaction and realized the characters didn't immediately know the name of this place, I had the same thought about a cool title card moment lol.
- Since I like this idea, I think we should stick in this direction.
- However, I think we need to make sure the cast learns the name Avernoth super early in the game because I want most of the game's dialogue after the intro to refer to this place as Avernoth.
- An idea: After clearing the first room, one of the mage's notes materializes in front of the player and discloses that this place's name is Avernoth.

With the word usage, the words are definitely used appropriately. I meant moreso that as the game's features, mechanics, and narrative develop, we'd have to make sure words like these (or whatever words we use) are used throughout the game consistenly so the player isn't confused. I should've worded that better. That part of my feedback was meant to be something to keep in mind rather than something that needed to be fixed.

7 total dialogues is a little much considering that this is still the first pass of text in the game. I'd rather get 5 total for this week and provide feedback that gives a better picture for what the rest of the text should look like. So, I'm asking for:
- Game boot dialogue
- You died for the first time dialogue (Have Magnus talk to the player here)
- 3 subsequent death dialogues (I have to preference for who is involved in these)
