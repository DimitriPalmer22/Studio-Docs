To get a feel for how this dialogue would feel in-game, I plugged it into Relapse's dialogue system and read it a couple times.

### What I Like
- I really like the level of familiarity between Allister and Magnus. it was really nice to be able to understand the relationship between these two characters without being explicitly told.
- I really like the sarcasm and attitude the characters have in the dialogue. Honestly, I think this can be something that remains consistent through the game.

### Small Changes

- I think its a good idea to write the rival mage's name in the dialogue. Specifically when Allister says "that bastard", he can say "that bastard Hidetomo" or something like that.
- That one line from Magnus that starts with "Indeed!" is long. Idk if it is meant to be one big paragraph in-engine, but it needs to be broken up into a series of smaller lines

### Might Be a Little Too Dense

- I'm comfortable with the length of this first interaction just because it introduces the player to the world. But I feel this interaction is too dense with new information for the player for the player to take it in all at once.
- I personally found that during Relapse's development, we had a couple issues with us trying to convey too many new concepts to the player at once.
	- At one point, our tutorials tried to introduce too many mechanics at once, and it was overwhelming for players. They ended up not understanding them fully or not utilizing the information they learned afterward. Tutorializing a new mechanic / system without almost immediately introducing it through gameplay also frequently resulted in players forgetting what they learned.
	- At another point, our dialogue tried to introduce too much of the game's world and plot at once, and it was overwhelming for players. Essential information was in this dialogue too, so it eventually resulted in players getting a confused with the narrative.
	- I think a little bit of these things might happen here.

- Some key things the player learns in this interaction
	- Allister is currently in the Seal Realm, away from everyone else in the real world
	- Allister was sent to the Seal Realm by some guy
	- Magnus also casted a spell that allows Allister to restart after dying
	- Magnus interfered w/ the spell, allowing for allies to help Allister (they still cannot enter the Seal Realm)
	- Allister *was* a badass, but his mana has been stripped
	- This place is dangerous. Nobody's ever gotten out and there are monsters

These things, along with the additional lines to make the dialogue feel more alive, are a lot to take in at once. I think this can be remedied by deferring some info to later interactions:
- The idea that Magnus casted a spell that allows Allister to restart after dying can be moved to after the player dies for the first time.
- The lines about Magnus and friends specifically being able to copy spells to Magnus's tome can be moved to the first instance of Allister getting a boon.

Maybe after moving some of these things somewhere else, each idea can have more room to breathe. Overall, though, it's gonna be important to see how people interpret this information when (if) we do playtesting.

### Another Concern I Had

Just from playing with the dialogue in Relapse, I can see a possible issue arising (which you probably don't have to worry about. This is just something to keep in mind). It was especially apparent because this specific sequence was pretty long. To me, when I'm in this dialogue sequence, the game (Relapse) feels very static.

I don't mean the dialogue itself. I mean the game as a whole seems visually uninteresting while I'm in this sequence. The dialogue seems so vibrant and full of character while nothing is really happening in the background. I want the game's dialogue to get the same love that the rest of the game does.

I'm not completely confident that adding character portraits on the screen is enough to remedy this, either. Some *juice* needs to be added to the game to make it feel more alive while the dialogue is happening. Honestly, if we can find ways to make the dialogue feel even more alive, we may even be able to make each interaction a little longer.
A couple things I thought of are:
- Coloring important words
- Animating the text box
- Having the screen react to specific lines (shaking, zooming in on a character)
- Subtly animating the MC's model during dialogue OR having dynamic effects on the "portal" that the ally is talking through based on the line that is currently being said
- panning the camera back and forth between the characters as they speak
- Subtle sfx for starting dialogue, ending dialogue, going from line-to-line, and sfx for each word popping up during dialogue

If you have any other ideas for this, lmk

### A Couple Questions
- What exactly did you imagine the character to be doing during this dialogue?
	- When you put "–Player approaches portal–", do you imagine the main character ACTUALLY walking to the portal?
	- Or do you imagine a black screen or something until the player gets to that point in the interaction?
- At this point in the game, did you imagine the characters not knowing the name of the "Avernoth", which is why they're referring to it as "the Seal Realm"? Is this something they find out later?
- This isn't rly a question, but I realized some of the game's vocabulary words need to be pinned down.
