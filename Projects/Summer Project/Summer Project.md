## 1. Three Creative Pillars

| Pillar               | Core Question                                                        | Outcome |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **Emotional Spine**  | What core feeling do we want players to experience every 10 minutes? |         |
| **Interactive Hook** | Which single mechanic will define the loop and reinforce the spine?  |         |
| **Narrative Thread** | What story beat anchors player choice to world reaction?             |         |

## 2. Constraints‑Driven Brainstorming

- **List your hard limits**
	- Small team size
	- Team composition
		- 5 artists
		- 1 programmers
		- 7 designers
	- Team experience with Unreal Engine
	- Limited time for the project
	- Limited budget
	- Communication (We don't see each other in person regularly)
- **Reframe each limit as a fuel question**
	- How can we turn our small team size into a project with a more focused scope?
		- Understand that we have a small team, so any new features should be easy to implement.
	- How can we leverage our numerous designers to make up for the limited number of artists and programmers?
		- Kitbashing (Ian Hubert)
		- Reusing assets in as many places as possible.
		- Areas can have the same assets but be set-dressed differently to make them distinct
		- Use of modular asset kits
		- Turn designers into in-engine technical artists to help with the art pipeline
	- How can we use our limited experience with Unreal Engine to create a game that is easy to develop?
		- Use blueprints for everything
		- Use existing assets from the marketplace
		- Use existing templates from the marketplace
		- Use existing plugins from the marketplace
		- Follow tutorials to recreate things
		- Also, just get better at Unreal
	- Limited time -> smaller scope / easier game to develop
	- Limited budget -> free assets / plugins / templates. Also, we'll create our own assets.
	- How do we turn the fact that we don't see each other in person into a positive?
		- We no longer have the restrictions of workshop, so we can work on the project whenever / however much we want.
		- Being able to work in call together allows us to rapidly get feedback from each other and iterate on ideas
