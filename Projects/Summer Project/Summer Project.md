## 1. Three Creative Pillars

| Pillar               | Core Question                                                        | Outcome |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **Emotional Spine**  | What core feeling do we want players to experience every 10 minutes? |         |
| **Interactive Hook** | Which single mechanic will define the loop and reinforce the spine?  |         |
| **Narrative Thread** | What story beat anchors player choice to world reaction?             |         |

	-

	-
- **Rapid‑fire ideation (15 m)**:
	-
- **Cluster & prune**:
