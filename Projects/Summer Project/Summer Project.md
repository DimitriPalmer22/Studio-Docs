## 1. Three Creative Pillars

| Pillar               | Core Question                                                        | Outcome |

		- x designers
	- Team experience with Unreal Engine
	- Limited time for the project
	- Limited budget

- **Reframe each limit as a fuel question**
	- How can we turn our small team size into a project with a more focused scope?
		- Understand that we have a small team, so any new features should be easy to implement.
	- How can we leverage our numerous designers to make up for the limited number of artists and programmers?
		- Kitbashing
		- Reusing assets in as many places as possible. 
		- Areas can have the same assets but be set-dressed differently to make them distinct
		- Use of modular asset kits
		- Turn designers into in-
