## 1. Three Creative Pillars

| Pillar               | Core Question                                                        | Outcome |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **Emotional Spine**  | What core feeling do we want players to experience every 10 minutes? |         |
| **Interactive Hook** | Which single mechanic will define the loop and reinforce the spine?  |         |
| **Narrative Thread** | What story beat anchors player choice to world reaction?             |         |

## 2. Constraints‑Driven Brainstorming

- **List your hard limits**
	- Small team size
	- Team composition
		- x artists
		- x programmers
		- x designers
	- Team experience with Unreal Engine
	- Limited time for the project
	- Limited budget
	- Communication (We don't see each other in person regularly)
- **Reframe each limit as a fuel question**
	- How can we turn our small team size into a project with a more focused scope?
		- Understand that we have a small team, so any new 
	- How can we leverage our numerous designers to make up for the limited number of artists and programmers?
