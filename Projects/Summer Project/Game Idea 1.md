## 0. Jotting down Ideas

- Genre: Fantasy (Magic) Roguelike

- Every time you start a run, you are given a series of random questions from a very LARGE pool of possible questions (Use data assets or something for this)
	- These questions have a LARGE list of possible responses
	- Each response does something random (well, not entirely random. The response will have a general mood, and based on that mood, the effect will be different)
	- This serves as our initial character building, which we go into the rest of the run with.
	- Note: The player's answers to the questions will be stored in a page at the front / back of the ***Tome*** for the duration of the run.
	- **IDEA**: For long-term progrssion, we can unlock more questions at the start of our runs AND a wider selection of questions / responses.
		- For example, when booting the game for the very first time, the player gets a sequence of 3 random questions from a list of like 10 total.
		- As we get further through the game and defeat more bosses, we unlock more questions to choose from / more answers to choose from / a longer sequence of questions.
		- The questions / responses you unlock are tied to in-game achievements.
		- The number of questions in the beginning sequence is tied to how far you've made it in your runs / how many times you made it very far.

## 1. Three Creative Pillars

| Pillar               | Core Question                                                        | Outcome                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Emotional Spine**  | What core feeling do we want players to experience every 10Â minutes? | Every choice they make is important. Choices lead to a sense of power (not overwhelming or underwhelming.) |
| **Interactive Hook** | Which single mechanic will define the loop and reinforce the spine?  |                                                                                                            |
| **Narrative Thread** | What story beat anchors player choice to world reaction?             |                                                                                                            |
