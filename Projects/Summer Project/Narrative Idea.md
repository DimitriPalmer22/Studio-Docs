### Basic Summary

- There's this huge war going on between **Faction 1** and **Faction 2**
- The player plays as **Main Character**, a powerful mage who fights for **Faction 1**. **Main Character**'s presence alone is enough to turn the tide of the war in **Faction 1**'s favor.
- However, during a pivotal battle in this war against another powerful mage named **Rival Mage**, **Main Character** was caught off-guard and stripped of their powers. Because of this, **Rival Mage** sealed **Main Character** away with a powerful spell.
	- However, before being completely sealed away, an ally of **Main Character** interfered with the sealing spell.
	- This interference allows for people outside of the seal's realm to interact with the player a little bit
		- Conceptually, I think of this kinda like the boons in **Hades**.
- The sealing spell sends **Main Character** to a prison realm named **Seal Realm**, where they are trapped in an environment that continuously transforms and is filled with enemies.
- Throughout the course of the game, the player is trying to escape **Seal Realm** while also building their strength.
- Once they escape, **Main Character** aims to turn the tides of the war.
	- This will be conveyed through a cutscene or something
	- Or, as a stretch goal, maybe the player can play through the final battle against **Rival Mage**.

#### Faction 1
- da good guys idk

#### Faction 2
- da bad guys idk

#### Why Are They at War?
- They're fighting over some resource.

> Note: I want whatever this resource is to be something magical. Also, it should have medical applications or something. This way, any health powerups the player finds can be explained as being made from this resource. Also, I want this resource to be visually reoccurring throughout the game within the game's "safe spaces". This way, the player will be able to recognize it and associate it the game's world OUTSIDE the **Seal Realm**.

### Conveying the Game's Story to the Player

- Narrative is mainly conveyed in areas where the player is safe from combat.

#### Interaction Gateways
- In these "safe spaces" are **Interaction Gateways**
- **Interaction Gateways** are portals from outside **Seal Realm** that allow **Main Character**'s allies to converse w/ **Main Character**.
- **Main Character**'s allies provide information about the world, the war, and **Main Character**'s past.

> - For right now, I don't know if I want communication to be one-way through **Interaction Gateways**. Should **Main Character** be able to respond to their allies? Should they be able to ask questions?
> - Also, I don't know how expository this communication should be. Shouldn't **Main Character** know this stuff already since they're an established person in this world?
	- Should the dialogue focus moreso on the current state of the war and **Main Character**'s allies rather than the lore of the world?
	- Or, maybe **Main Character** is just a really strong guy who has never really cared to learn about the politics / history of their world.

- **Rival Mage** is the main recurring antagonist of the game. As such, they have their own **Interaction Gateways** that appear after certain events.
	- The might appear after boss fights or randomly after clearing rooms
#### Safe Spaces Where We Do the Dialogue Thing
- **The Starting Room** - The starting room is an empty room that somewhat resembles a prison cell. Inside this room is an **Interaction Gateway** that allows **Main Character** to communicate with their allies. This room is the player's starting point and is where they will spawn after dying.
	- The first time the player plays the game, this **Interaction Gateway** will have a character named **Ally 1** who will explain their situation.
- Shop
- Item rooms or something idk
- Boss rooms after beating the boss

#### Allies
- **Ally 1** - This character is the first ally that **Main Character** meets. They are the one who interfered with the sealing spell and are the one who explains the situation to **Main Character**. They are a powerful mage who has been fighting for **Faction 1** for a long time.
- The rest of the allies have less story significance and are just there to provide information about the world and the war.
- Idea: Much like other rogue-likes, the player randomly meets new people as they progress through the game, which unlocks those NPCs for use in later playthroughs
	- In this game, we will see these characters in the **Interaction Gateways** (throughout the game and at the start of each run)

#### Explicit Acknowledgement of the Loop
- Every time the player respawns in the starting room, the **Interaction gateway** that is in the center of the room contains a different character. They'll say something from a pool of text lines that are all about **Main Character** dying again.
