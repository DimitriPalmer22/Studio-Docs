Matthew's level will be the POC level. We are going to hard-focus getting all of those asset to look nice and play well with each other. I want to get a real feel of how the game will look and feel.

### Programmers
I'm working on adding an attack system for the spells and aim to have a simple attack working as soon as possible.

The next thing I want to do is implement enemies. They will not move or attack, but I need them to take damage and die.

Also, by the end of the week, I want the ability to spawn in a room, kill enemies, and have a dialogue interaction pop up.

### Designers

#### Level Designers

Make Levels using Matthew's modular kit & see how they can be used to create different room shapes. Matthew's kit is the base for the modular kit, and we'll take pieces from the other kits to add more variety.

- Mikel - 1 Level
- Leonardo - 1 Level
- Brian - 1 Level
- Aiden - 1 Level
- Ashley - 1 Level
- Matthew - 1 Level

#### Technical Designers

Research more into the process of importing animations into Unreal and how they will work with the enemies. Also look more into animation blueprints, animation retargeting, and animation montages.

### Artists

#### Environmental Artists

Matthew made a few placeholder props, so we have a decent idea for what kinds of things will be found in the levels. We can send those to the artists and get real versions of those in the game.

Also, we need to start getting real models / textures for the modular kit pieces.

To be specific, here are most if not all the props currently in that level.
- Piles of books
- Banners
- Circular bookshelves
- The very tall pillars
- Big table
- Small table
- Chandelier
- Smaller hanging lights
- Big painting
- Small painting

For this week, we wanted to get you guys to go in-engine yourselves to export the modelsIf the static mesh isn't already in the level's folder ready to be exported, you're having trouble finding the asset, or if you just need one of us to export the fb, lmk:

#### Character Artist

Once the MC's completely finished, Lee can create the character's model. I at least want a version we can put in-engine to see if, once it's rigged, the animations can be retargeted to work w/ it.
- I *think* the MC's model should be about the same size & shape as Unreal's mannequin so that the animations can be retargeted easily.
- You don't have to worry about rigging the MC's model, that can be handled by someone else.

In the meantime, she can work on props alongside the environment artists.

#### 2D Artists

The concept art for the MC needs to be finalized so that the character artist can start working on the model. That shouldn't be too big of an issue since I think we were all liking the concept so far. We just need to make sure the colors are good.

After that, we can concept the designs and portraits for the other characters.

#### Animators

Once the MC's model is finished, it needs to be rigged to see if the animations on the current player model will work with it. It'd be huge if we don't have to recreate the animations from scratch specifically for this model

In the meantime, you can animate the current player model (Unreal's manny) to get a feel for the animations and how they will look in-game.

- James

### Narrative Designer

We can start to get the dialogue in-engine since the basics of the dialogue system are done.

Also, I added the task of importing the fonts to the list of tasks. I didn't explicitly say for you to apply the font to the current UI, but if that is something you want to do, let me know.
