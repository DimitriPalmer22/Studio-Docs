Proof of Concept lasts from Sunday, May 11 - Saturday, May 31 (21 Days)

Going into the first couple weeks for the project, we need to get a working proof of concept going. We need something that can serve as a base for all the MAJOR features we want in the game in the later parts of development. This way, it doesn't feel like we're pushing back anything significant to the game's identity.
