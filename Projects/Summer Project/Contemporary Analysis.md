### Possible Narrative References-

- **Virtue's last reward** - Time loop based visual novel, metanarrative includes acknowledgement of the "loop" with the player being surprised by different outcomes to different choices, good for branching narrative, maybe not so good depending on how much the game is expected to be replayed [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_Escape:_Virtue's_Last_Reward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_Escape:_Virtue's_Last_Reward "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_Escape:_Virtue's_Last_Reward")
- Outer wilds - Time loop based exploration game, in which the information discovered in previous loops is able to be used to progress the next time around, puzzles don't change, etc. [https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/ "https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/")
- _Undertale_ - Some characters can acknowledge that the player has gained some kind of meta knowledge when committing certain actions, and know when a file has been "reloaded" [https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/ "https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/")
- **Gnosia** - Time loop visual novel, death game where the "killers" and "victims" change every round, good for fast paced character development without committing to specific roles within the game.

- **Slay the princess** - Time loop visual novel, in which a single play through contains ~10 loops where the decisions made in a previous loop affect the characters/narrative of the next loop [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1989270/Slay_the_Princess__The_Pristine_Cut/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1989270/Slay_the_Princess__The_Pristine_Cut/ "https://store.steampowered.com/app/1989270/Slay_the_Princess__The_Pristine_Cut/")
