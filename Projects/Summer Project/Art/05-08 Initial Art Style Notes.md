> Note: This is not the Art Style Guide.

# Overview
- Overall, we're going with a non-photorealistic art style for this project.
- In particular, I've been really drawn to the PS1 / PSX art style for a couple reasons:
	- Could be really interesting to try and modernize
	- Lower quality assets could help with getting more things done within the time we have
- The goal is to have a low-poly art style that is still visually appealing and interesting.

### The PS1 / PSX Art Style

#### Things I Want
- The low-poly aesthetic of the PS1 era. All models should generally have some pretty hard angles. Even circular objects have very noticable edges.
- Low res textures. I want to try and keep the texture resolution low, but not so low that it becomes hard to tell what you're looking at.
- Reduced Color Depth. Most games on the PS1 used a 15-bit color depth.

#### Things I Don't Want
- The weird vertex warping on models that happened as a result of the PS1's hardware limitations
- The weird texture warping that happened as a result of the PS1's hardware limitations
- The extreme pixelization due to the PS1's low resolution. I feel like trying to do this on modern screens would make the scene harder to read
- The low framerate found in many PSX games. A lot of those ran at 15-20 FPS, which is not something I want to replicate. I want the game to target 60 FPS.

# Models
- Even though we're going for a low-poly art style, I don't want everything in the game to be completely flat to the point where we solely rely on textures to add detail.

# Textures
-

# Post Processing
-

# UI
- Given that the game has a retro

# Modernizing the Look
- The goal is to modernize the PS1 look, not just copy it. This means that we can take some liberties in some areas to make our game stand out a little more.
- We can do things like
	- Abuse Unreal Engine's lighting
	- Use post-processing effects
	- Use particles & VFX at every opportunity
	- Provide visual feedback to the player every time they do something (add a camera shake, play an animation, have the UI do the dougie idk)
