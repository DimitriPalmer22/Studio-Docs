### Things We Liked

- We generally like the color palette of the MC
- The designs you sent were pretty cool
	- In terms of clothing, I think most people are kinda leaning towards design 3 as their favorite. The accessories are a nice added touch
	- I personally also like the necklace in design 1
	- I also personally like the jagged wizard hat designs in 1 and 2
		- Jagged tail in 1
		- Floppy lid in 2

### Main Changes

- Allister is supposed to be a little older (early 30s) and we want the design to reflect that
- Also, we want the design to look a little less "cute"
	- At first glance, people's first reactions shouldn't be "look at this little guy"
- Also, we want the character to be a little taller.
- The body type should be a *little* bit more imposing
	- He shouldn't be this big strong guy
	- We just want to make sure he's not super slim and
