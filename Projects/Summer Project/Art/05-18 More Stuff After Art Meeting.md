### Mipping
- In the level of detail section, make sure the "mip gen settings" are left at whatever default value Unreal puts it at.
- Most of the values here are fine, just as long as you don't accidentally select "NoMipmaps", which causes some weird aliasing issues with the textures.

### Compression
- Since the textures themselves are already going to be 128x128 or 256x256
