So, I played around in-engine and tried to find something that could work roughly for the environmental assets. I placed some temporary materials on the assets just to see what would work and what wouldn't.

I was also playing around with the lighting, dithering / pixelation shader, and the fog to get a better idea of what the game would look like in a more finished state.
