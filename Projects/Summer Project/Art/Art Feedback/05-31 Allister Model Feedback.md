# More Allister 3D Model Notes

### Shirt

One thing I noticed is these parts of the model right here.

I wanted to ask if these are supposed to be the same parts of Allister's shirt as I circled in the reference image.

If they are, then this looks to me more like a t-shirt rather than the vest he's wearing in the concept art.

Of course, though, I could be wrong and this could look exactly like the concept art once the model is textured.

### Head Shape

I think the head shape in the model might be a little too narrow. Specifically, I think the outer portion of the lower jaw could be a little more prominent.

This could also just be an angle thing.
