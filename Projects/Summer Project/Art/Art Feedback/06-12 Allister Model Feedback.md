Right now, Allister's go straight all the way down, so it doesn't look like he has ankles. Could you make his legs a little skinnier at the bottom to make his ankles more visible?

Something about the way the calves are exaggerated looks a little off to me. I think it's because the calves aren't flatter from the front like the ones in the refs.
