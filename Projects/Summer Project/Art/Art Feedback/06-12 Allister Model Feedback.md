Right now, Allister's go straight all the way down, so it doesn't look like he has ankles. Could you make his legs a little skinnier at the bottom to make his ankles more visible?

The thighs are fire.

Something about the way the calves are exaggerated looks a little off to me. I think it's because the calves aren't flatter from the front with the calf's thickness coming from the sides and back like the ones in the refs.

Generally, in these models, I see the calves following a more pentagonal shape. The front of the leg is flatter. Then the sides connecting to the front go backwards and out a bit to make the calf seem wide. Then, they come back in at a point at the back of the leg.
