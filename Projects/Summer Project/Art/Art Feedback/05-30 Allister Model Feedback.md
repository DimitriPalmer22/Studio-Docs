### Allister's Hat

- Can you make the rim around the hat a little thinner?
- Also, can you make the rim of his hat a little "bendier" (the hat's rim might have to be a little bit wider to accomodate this)?
- I think the point of the hat is a little too far back and could be off to the side a bit more.
- Can you make the string that holds the hanging accessory a teeny bit shorter?

For reference, this is Vivi from Final Fantasy IX. Here, the rim of the hat has a much thinner rim, and pretty much has no thickness to it. This is probably because the devs wanted to save polygons, but it still looks really good and is honestly more like what I want for Allister.

This is Black Waltz #2, also from FFIX (You can also look up Black Waltz #1 and #3 for more references). Here, we also see a thinner rim, but the bendiness of the hat adds the illusion of thickness to it. This hat is actually really wide and almost extends past the character's really wide shoulders. I'm thinking Allister's hat should be similar in that regard.

> Note: It's a little hard to find images / an actual model of Black Waltz #2 online. So, I'll just drop this video of the character in action here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nlDVBhxApc>

Also, Vivi in the above image is another example of the hat's rim being thinner and more bendy. The rim of the hat is also a little wider compared to his body, which gives it a more "wizard-y" look

In terms of the point of Allister's hat being too far back, I think Black Waltz #2's hat is more like the shape I want.

In the screenshot above, Allister's hat gradually sweeps back to the point, which makes the hat seem a little short when viewed at certain angles. On the other hand, Black Waltz #2's hat is much more vertical and then abrubtly juts out backwards (maybe too abrubptly). As a result, Black Waltz #'s hat seems taller and doesn't go out backwards as far as Allister's hat does, which makes it look more like a pointy wizard hat.

I think the string holding the hanging accessory is a little too long right now and doesn't exactly match the concept art.

### The Hands

From the images you sent, I can't say too too much about the hands. When you get a chance, can you send an image of those from a top-down view so I can see how exactly its set up? I just wanna see if all 4 fingers are connected together and the thumb is separate (like a lot of PS1 character models)

### The Feet

This is Seifer from Final Fantasy VIII. I think his feet are a good reference for Allister's feet. I think the shape  sizeis pretty good in these pics.
