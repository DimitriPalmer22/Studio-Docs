### Allister's Hat

- Can you make the rim around the hat a little thinner?
- Also, can you make the rim of his hat a little "bendier" (the hat's rim might have to be a little bit wider to acommodate this)?
- I think the point of the hat is a little too far back and could be off to the side a bit more.

For reference, this is Vivi from Final Fantasy IX. Here, the rim of the hat has a much thinner rim, and pretty much has no thickness to it. This is probably because the devs wanted to save polygons, but it still looks really good.

This is Black Waltz 2, also from FFIX (You can also look up Black Waltz 1 and 3 for more references). Here, we also see a thinner rim, but the bendiness of the hat adds the illusion of thickness to it. This hat is actually really wide and almost extends past the character's really wide shoulders. I'm thinking Allister's hat should be similar in that regard.

In terms of the point of Allister's hat being too far back, I think Black Waltz #2's hat is more like the shape I want.
