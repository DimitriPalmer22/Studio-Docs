### Pivots

Making sure the pieces are pivoted properly and consistently is gonna save the LDs a lot of headache in the long run. So, I'm writing this just to make sure things are easier for them

I think most of the pieces are properly pivoted in-engine, but I'm not sure if that'll carry over once they're exported.

Also, quick note: when you guys are giving the pieces back to us, please make sure each piece is placed at (0, 0, 0) so that we don't have any weird issues with pieces moving once we replace the models.

#### Floors

The pivots of the floor pieces should be placed at the top back right corner of each piece.

#### Walls

The pivots of the wall pieces should be the bottom front right corner of the piece. This way, the floors and walls should line up very nicely (should the LDs choose to make the floors align with the walls)

#### Other Pieces

##### Columns
The pivots of the columns should be at the back bottom middle (in the bottom middle of the flat side of the column)

##### Corner Pieces

The pivot of the corner pieces should be the bottom back corner of the piece (the bottom corner that is furthest from the hypotenuse of the triangle).

##### Archways

The pivots for the archway pieces should be the bottom front middle of the piece (at the front in the middle of the archway's gap).

Also, small note about the archways. I could be crazy, but I don't think the left and right legs of the archway are the same width.

### Note About the Rotation of Some Assets

If you notice that any of the pieces are strangely rotated (like a wall is laying flat on the ground or a floor is standing up), let us know. That might have been a mistake

### Note about the Scale of Some Assets

I believe all of the assets are scaled properly. Some even have their dimensions in their names.

BUT, if you notice that an asset's name doesn't match it's dimensions, let us know. There may have been a mistake when making the static mesh in-engine.
