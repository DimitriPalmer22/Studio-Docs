### Pivots

Making sure the pieces are pivoted properly and consistently is gonna save the LDs a lot of headache in the long run. So, I'm writing this just to make sure things are easier for them

I think most of the pieces are properly pivoted in-engine, but I'm not sure if that'll carry over once they're exported.

#### Floors

The pivots of the floor pieces should be placed at the top back right corner of each piece.

#### Walls

#### Other Pieces

##### Columns
The pivots of the columns should be at the back bottom middle (in the bottom middle of the flat side of the column)

### Note About the Rotation of Some Assets

If you notice that any of the pieces are strangely rotated (like a wall is laying flat on the ground or a floor is standing up), let us know. That might have been a mistake
