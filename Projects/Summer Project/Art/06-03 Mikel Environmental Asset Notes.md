#### Note About the Rotation of Some Assets

Some of Mikel's static mesh files are rotated improperly and need be properly rotated before giving them back to the designers. In particular
- Corner_200w_1000h_200d and Corner_500w_1000h_500d need to be upright

This isn't a comprehensive list. These are just some of the ones I've noticed.
