#### Note About the Rotation of Some Assets

Some of Mikel's static mesh files are rotated improperly and need be properly rotated before giving them back to the designers. In particular
- Corner_200w_1000h_200d and Corner_500w_1000h_500d need to be upright
- RoofSupport_50x1000 is supposed to be sideways.
- Roofsupport_diagonal is supposed to be at a 45 degree angle
- Rail_25x125 is supposed to be sideways

This isn't a comprehensive list. These are just some of the ones I've noticed.

#### Pivots

#### Floors

#### Walls

#### Other Pieces

##### Columns
The pivots of the columns should be at the back bottom middle (in the bottom middle of the flat )
