### Note About the Rotation of Some Assets

Some of Mikel's static mesh files are rotated improperly and need be properly rotated before giving them back to the designers. In particular
- RoofSupport_50x1000 is supposed to be sideways.
- Roofsupport_diagonal is supposed to be at a 45 degree angle
- Rail_25x125 is supposed to be sideways

This isn't a comprehensive list. These are just some of the ones I've noticed.

### Pivots

Making sure the pieces are pivoted properly and consistently is gonna save the LDs a lot of headache in the long run. So, I'm writing this just to make sure things are easier for them

#### Floors

#### Walls

#### Other Pieces

##### Columns
The pivots of the columns should be at the back bottom middle (in the bottom middle of the flat side of the column)
