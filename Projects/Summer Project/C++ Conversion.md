I've been working on a separate branch to convert the project to C++, and now I'm ready to merge it into main. The thing is, not everyone's computer is set up to work with a C++ project. So, I put together a little tutorial to help them get started.

The tutorial is based off of this video, so you should watch it and follow along with the steps in this doc: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaBVxtG4xdY>

# Step 0: BEFORE Pulling the C++ Commit
At the time of writing this, I probably haven't even pushed the C++ commit yet. But, before you pull (while you can still open the project), do this first.

1. Open Unreal
2. Open the project
3. Go to Edit > Editor Preferences
