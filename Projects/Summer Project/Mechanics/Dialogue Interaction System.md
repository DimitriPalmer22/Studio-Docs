I need some way to represent the dialogue system in-engine so that dialogue can start being implemented properly.
# What is a Dialogue Interaction?

- A dialogue interaction is a list of *"Dialogue Lines"* from one or more characters.
- During these interactions, there is no user input into what is said. These interactions are predefined.

### Dialogue Line

- A single line of dialogue spoken by one person.
	- Can be more than one sentence or even a sentence fragment

Dialogue Lines are characterized by:
- Who is saying the line

# Where is Dialogue Found?

In our game, there are "rooms".

# How Do We Determine Which Dialogue Lines Play

### Flags

We'll use *flags* / tags / values that tell us more about each line of dialogue. Each dialogue interaction is defined

### Forced Dialogue Lines
