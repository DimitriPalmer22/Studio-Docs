The dodge mechanic in the game allows the player to evade incoming attacks by quickly moving out of the way. Also, the player is invincible during the dodge, making it a useful tool for avoiding damage. The dodge is primarily used to avoid damage, but can also be used to traverse short distances or to reposition during combat.

The dodge is performed by pressing the dodge button, which can be mapped to a specific key or controller button.

There are different dodge animations the player can acquire during their current run.

### Dodge 1: Sidestep

The player begins the game with a quick short-ranged sidestep that can go in any direction depending on the player's input.

### Dodge 2: Twirl

The player gracefully twirls in while dodging, allowing them to dodge incoming attacks while also looking stylish. This dodge has a longer cooldown than the sidestep but provides a larger invincibility window. This ability also has the added effect of reflecting small projectiles.

### Dodge 3: Flashstep

The player damn near teleports a longer distance in the direction of their input. This dodge has a much longer travel distance, but the duration of the dodge is shorter than that of the twirl
