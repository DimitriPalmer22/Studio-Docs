The dodge mechanic in the game allows the player to evade incoming attacks by quickly moving out of the way. Also, the player is invincible during the dodge, making it a useful tool for avoiding damage. The dodge is primarily used to avoid damage, but can also be used to traverse short distances or to reposition during combat.

The dodge is performed by pressing the dodge button, which can be mapped to a specific key or controller button.

There are different dodge animations the player can acquire during their current run.

### Dodge 1: 

The player begins the game with a quick short-ranged sidestep that can go in any direction depending on the player's input.

### Dodge 2: Twirl
