- A stat is a struct that contains the following:
	- Name - a constant integer value (can be predefined by define macros or an enum)
	- Current value - the current value of the stat
	- Maximum value - the maximum value of the stat
	- Minimum value - the minimum value of the stat

# Character Stats

### What Are the Character Stats?

- Vitality - Determines the maximum health of a character
- Mana - Determines the maximum mana of a character

- Intelligence - Determines the damage done by a spell
- Resistance - Reduces the damage taken from physical attacks
- Agility - Overall speed & dodge range / invincibility frames
	- In terms of the invincibility frames, think of this like 2k, where the stat doesn't linearly correlate to the expected output. Instead, it acts as a threshold that unlocks different tiers the higher the stat is.
	- For example, 1x agility may give you 10 invincibility frame, while 2x agility may give you 15 invincibility frames, and so on.
- Cast Speed - How quickly a character can cast spells. Also affects cooldown times
