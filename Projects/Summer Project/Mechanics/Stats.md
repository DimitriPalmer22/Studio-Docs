### What Are the Stats?

- Vitality - Determines the maximum health of a character
- Mana - Determines the maximum mana of a character
-
- Power - Determines the damage done by a spell
- Resistance - Reduces the damage taken from physical attacks
- Agility - Overall speed & dodge range / invincibility frames
	- In terms of the invincibility frames, think of this like 2k, where the stat doesn't linearly correlate to the expected output. Instead, it acts as a threshold that unlocks different tiers the higher the stat is.
	- For example, 1x agility may give you 10 invincibility frame, while 2x agility may give you 15 invincibility frames, and so on.
