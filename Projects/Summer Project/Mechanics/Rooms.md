Rooms themselves have no randomly generated components inside of them (aside from loot or something that might spawn when you complete the room). They are pre-configured by our designers.

# What is a Room?
- A room is closed-in isolated space.
- The player is teleported into one of these with no clear way out.
- The player needs to clear the room of enemies to progress to the next room.
	- Each room can either have 1 set of enemies or have several waves of enemies that attack the player

# What Parts Make Up A Room?
- A spawning point for the player (where they appear when they start the room). This doesn't need to be denoted by anything specific.
- A small portal / ritual area that acts as the exit point. *THIS IS NOT A DOOR*. Before the player clears the room, this should be unlit & boring to look at. After the player clears the room, this should be lit up and look like a portal. This is how the player gets to the next room and progresses through the game.
- Enemy spawn points. Rooms define where exactly enemies can spawn, but not the enemies themselves. The enemies that spawn in a room are determined randomly and selected from a pool of possible enemies.
