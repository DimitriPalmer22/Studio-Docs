### Lighting

- The area where the player should be most frequently engaged in combat should be the most illuminated.
- Side rooms, fake rooms, and any non-enterable spaces should be lit as well to make the environment feel believable. These rooms should be darker with more secondary and tertiary lighting to create a more dramatic background

- Primary lighting: Washed out cool colors (primarily white with cool hues; blue, cyan)
	- Wall lanterns
	- Hanging lanterns
	- Chandeliers (chandeliers will use crystals instead of candles for uniqueness and continuity, to keep the primary lighting consistent)

- Secondary/detail lighting: Warm colors (orange, yellow, red)
	- Candles (placed in areas where a person would want to read/study; on/near bookshelves, desks, tables, books)

- Tertiary/accent lighting: More saturated cool colors (deep blues)
	- Crystals and VFX: emissive lighting only, good to place in darker corners where light doesn't reach as well

# Getting the Vibe Right

### Skybox

- change the color of the skybox
	- The player needs to feel like they are not in a normal space (not the real world dimension)
- Atmosphere - should feel somewhat hellish
	- Should feel a little bit of dread
	- This can be helped with the skybox
	- Sound design could help too
- HDRI Haven for skyboxes

### Sound

- Andre asked Matthew to put some sounds or sum in his level.
	- Solid amount of reference material to work on something (sound-design wise)
	- Before we get any sounds or anything, we need to make sure the vibe is established
	- He can probably get some demos

- Matthew used FMOD. He handled implementation of sound in Realm Runner.
	- Super good for things like detailed ambience
- Footsteps, some ambience, a chiller backing track of some sort

- A list of all the stuff in the showcase (feature-wise)
- A list of all the stuff in the showcase (that need sounds)
