- Areas w/ combat should be the most illuminated.
- Side rooms / fake rooms / any non-enterable spaces should be lit, but should have more secondary and tertiary lighting
- This will create more dramatic background

- Primary lighting:
- Secondary lighting:
- Tertiary lighting:

- change the color of the skybox
	- The player needs to feel like they are not in a normal space (not the real world dimension)
- Atmosphere - should feel somewhat hellish
	- Should feel a little bit of dread
	- This can be helped with the skybox
	- Sound design could help too
- HDRI Haven for skyboxes

- Andre asked Matthew to put some sounds or sum in his level.
	- Solid amount of reference material to work on something (sound-design wise)
	- Before we get any sounds or anything, we need to make sure the vibe is established
	- He can probably get some demos
