### 2D Artist Goal for This Week
- Have a DONE character portrait.
	- Magnus
	- Character concept
	- Portrait
- Sunday deadline

#### Style
- Blend of Stray Gods and Hades
- Alecks says he might make his own PureRef to see the differences between the two styles (honestly this could go in the new Miro board)
- We could go with a more detailed approach

### Different Expressions for Portraits

- As a stretch goal, we will have different expressions for the characters. A portrait for each
- We need to get the initial portraits

### What Are All the Docs We Need to Be Using When Designing Characters?

- The initial character PureRef and the intial character concepts doc have both been put into the Miro board
- If anyone makes any narrative documentation that is relevant to the character designs, they should ping the 2D artists and also put it in the Miro board
- When it comes to the technicals of making the portraits, read the portrait pureref (i'll eventually put this in the Miro board)

### Small Note From Alex

- Everyone has dark hair lol
- Maybe we should change that?
- Blonde? Red?
- Also, Zhytomyra's hair is supposed to be graying

### Documentation

- Document things like base colors, accent colors, mood, etc.
- Documenting things like this in one area would definitely be a big help

### How much Freedoms Do the Artists Have when it Comes to Designing These Characters?

- If anything, the artists can ping the discord for opinions on designs so we can have a more iterative process
