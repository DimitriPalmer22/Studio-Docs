### Color Palette

- Serves as a good baseline
- In terms of specificity, what we need is a color palette with hex codes
	- Color picker wont work due to lighting variations and whatnot. GIVE HEX CODES

### Texturing Style

- Are we still hand-dithering in photoshop? NO
- More specific style references for how the game is supposed to look (In terms of PS1 visuals)
- A little bit of a contradiction between art notes and what we're being told to emulate.
	- Emulate psx style
	- Don't let the textures do the heavy lifting???
- Lower poly style and let the textures do the heavy lifting
	- Normal maps for the sake of lighting information

### Refs for Models

- Any time we have a ref more models, have a description for what we like about it. Elaboration is key.

### Communication

- Could be more responsive.
- The way Azalee's feedback was handled and the way the concepts for Allister were handled was pretty cool. More of that
- More feedback from LD is cool

### Kits?

Doing the kits:
- We'll be using Mikel's new kit instead for POC since you guys haven't done much work yet with Matthew's kit.
- Mikel's kit will probably be done by tonight so you guys can expect that to be ready by tomorrow.

### References for Props?

in the future, if there are props listed, but there are no references, more details would be helpful.
- If there's something you have in mind for what you want the prop to look like, please provide a description of what you want it to look like.
- "Table" and "Long Table" is too vague if there's something specific you want in mind or if there's a theme you're going for.

### Can I Ask about Getting References?
- Maybe don't ask for refs if there is no basis for what the idea is.
- Maybe for smaller individual props, the artists can gather refs themselves before working on the actual model. I can just okay the refs and they'll start working on the model
