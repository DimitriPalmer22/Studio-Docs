# Figure out the Lighting In-Engine?

- With the character art & environment art, there might be too much of a different style between the two. They might not be fully cohesive.
	- Character art has hard shadows n stuff
	- Environment has more traditional lighting
	- How do we fix this???

- There are too many variables at play here, so we need a way to control the visual style while interacting with the portal so that the 2D artists can make the art cohesive w/ the environment

### The Cutscene Idea
- When interacting with the portal, the player kinda goes to this new 'space' (that looks kinda portally). Here, this is where Allister can talk to whoever.
	- Animated skybox or something moving in the background just to keep the game visually interesting while talking to people
- This helps with keeping the environment art consistent while talking to peeps
- The game will transition in and out whenever the player interacts with the portal
	- Camera zooms into the portal (like a fly-in) <- This was Chelle's idea

### FIGURE OUT THE COLOR OF THE PORTAL AREA
- This is important for the coloring of the portraits as well
- I'm gonna try to make a mock-up of this whole sequence so we can get a much better idea of how this will look in-game

# Other Stuff
### Magnus's Character Design

- We good

### Portrait Dimensions

![](<../../../_Meta/Attachments/image(2).png>)

- This is a cropped version of Alecks's portrait
- This difference here compared to the original is that the image is cut off above the belt
- This is a lot closer to the layout of the portraits in Fire Emblem: Three Houses
- Also, I think the right hand would look better if it was dropped

![](<../../../_Meta/Attachments/image(3).png>)

- This is Alex's portrait
- This is a lot closer up to the face, so we gotta zoom this out a lil
- I like the idea of having the one hand up
- Also, this pic doesn't have the gloves

### Dithering

![](<../../../_Meta/Attachments/Pasted image 20250614112202.png>)

- After playing around with the dithering a bit more, it definitely does look cool
- BUTTTTT, the flatter shading & coloring kinda fights with the dithering. It makes it hard for the dithering to find something to work with, so it isn't as noticeable as it could be
- The dithering has much more texture in the hair because of the wider range of colors here.

- With this, on the other hand, the dithering had a lot more to work with in terms of colors and shading beforehand, so the dithering is applied in a much more noticeable way.

- Going forward, we can try some subtle gradients and rim lighting to help the dithering pop more.
- BUT, there is a risk of the dithering being too distracting if we go too far with it.
