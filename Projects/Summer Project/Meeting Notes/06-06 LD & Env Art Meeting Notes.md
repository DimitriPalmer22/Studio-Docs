# Looking through the Levels of the Designers

### Brian's Level

- The room currently feels TOO TALL
	- We need more small props for the player to be taller than
	- We need to fill up the roof space and upper walls
	- Adding an unreachable 2nd floor
	- If the character is supposed to be this powerful mage, its kinda weird for him to be so small
	- Maybe lowering the height of the ceiling in general

- Props and set-dressing
	- Try to keep the props along the walls to keep the main play area unobstructed

- Archways
	- Brian uses archways to add depth to his walls, but he only made the archways stick out halfway (half of the archways is inside the wall)
	- The designers commented that the archways should stick out all the way.

### Aiden's Level
- If the shape of the room was more interesting and less boxy, then the archways along the wall would look better
- The archways in the floor don't really serve a purpose here
	- Just because there are so many, they might make gameplay a little weird
- The gazebo is a little weird
	- Maybe make it a cage and raise it above the level
	- Having the player be able to walk inside it is weird

### LD Ideas that Were Brought up
- broken/fractured spaces in the walls/roof as the player descends further
- the placement of stairs and doors can also get more illogical as u go to reflect the mage's paranoia
- Leo brought up having some walls poking out to add detail. This would only be for smaller walls

### Lighting

Look over the lighting demonstration Andre did.
- He placed two large rect lights at the top of the room so that the entire area seemed pretty well lit
- Only *some* of the candles had lights on them
- Andre brought up the idea of fake lighting in games
	- Sometimes, in games, areas are much more well-lit than they would be in real life
	- This is because, yknow, players need to see
	- However, it is strange for a room to be well-lit, but there are no light source props in that room
	- So, Andre suggested that we add fake lighting props in the room
	- For example, we add a whole bunch of candles and open windows to sell the illusion that those are the things that are lighting up the room
		- Keep in mind, these candles and other lighting props are NOT actually lighting up the room (they don't have any point lights or anything on them)
		- Some of them can, but not all of them

- Also, there was too much orange light from the candles. I want the room to be a little less orange than it was in the demonstration.
