# POC Can Actually Be Delivered This Week

- I know that I've been pushing the POC deadline back a lot, but I think we can actually deliver a product this week.

### What We Have

- Dialogue system + some dialogue interactions
- A working power system
	- Tomes
	- Tome Upgrades
	- Changing Tomes
- Initial designs for the levels
- A very simple game loop for clearing rooms and entering the next one

### What We're Missing

- We need more props. LDs will put together a list
- An actual portrait for one of the characters, but that's in-progress
- The MC's model, but that's almost done
	- Also, new animations need to be put on the MC, but Andre has already done that once on his own personal branch. Once the C++ branch gets merged into main, he can do that again.
- Implementation of the concept UI. Alecks already sent his UI concepts like a week or 2 ago, but they need to be implemented in-engine.
- Any type of VFX for the powers to make them look like magic
	- A note about VFX: they don't NEED to be in for POC.
	- The VFX will be kinda like Relapse, where they are 2D, but in-engine

- Real powers
	- The placeholders I put in a couple weeks ago HAVE TO GO
- Any Enemy behavior
	- There's literally no enemy behavior
#### Env. Art Asset List
- Mikel is going to put together a list of props that we need. The other designers can also contribute to this list.
	- This can't *just* be a list of the types of props
	- Stylistic references are needed as well. Provide refs for the two bullet points below
		- What is the prop supposed to look like?
		- How is the prop supposed to look in a PS1 / low-poly style
- The environmental artists will work based off of what you send, so make sure to be as specific as possible
- Also, try to think about props that will decorate the upper sections of the rooms. They're not just going to be empty spaces, so we need props that will fill them up.

#### Character Portrait
- Magnus should be posed in a way that shows off his gloves

# C++ Conversion

DO THIS ASAP: [C++ Conversion](<../C++ Conversion.md>). YOUR PROJECT WILL NOT OPEN IF YOU DON'T DO THIS !!!

I plan to merge the C++ branch into main tomorrow some time around 2 to 4 pm. I'll ping the discord when I do.

I had to convert the project to C++ because I can't work efficiently while working in just blueprints. I NEED to code.

# What Have I Been Doing the past Week?

I was way busier than I expected last week. But, I spent the past week converting the project from C++ to blueprints.

This is what took up the majority of my time last week, which is why there have been like no updates on my part (even though I said I would give more updates).

With that being said, though, any feature I need to do should come out WAYYYYYYY quicker from now on.

# Dept. Meetings
